This project explores the impact of global warming in the USA by analyzing data on rising temperatures and greenhouse gas emissions. Our team analyzed the trends and patterns of temperature changes across different regions of the country, as well as the trends in greenhouse gas emissions. By identifying the correlation between temperature rise and greenhouse gas emissions, we aim to raise awareness of the impact of human activities on the environment and encourage actions to reduce emissions and reduce global warming effects in the future.
